<h5 id="#What is Qlik Sense?"> What is Qlik Sense? </h5>
    <p>
    Qlik sense is an application released by QlikTech, which is specifically used for visualizing and analyzing the data. It helps in building interactive dashboards and reports,
        <br>
     and also to extract the data from various data sources. It mostly serves as an analytics platform for technical as well as non-technical developers and works better
        </br>
     for data visualization as it has augmented graphics that help in effective visualization of data. 
    </p>
<h5 id="Qlik Sense Architecture">Qlik Sense Architecture Overview</h5>
    <p>
    Qlik Sense Architecture provides a scalable, secure, and manageable work environment for customers by offering high-quality services. It offers users with high visual
    <br> analytics and management tools.</br>

Before getting into the architecture of qlik sense, let's get to know the other major components which are associated with it. They are:
    </p>
        <ul>
        <li> Qlik Sense Hub  </li>
        <li> Qlik sense management console </li>
        </ul>
<h5> Qlik Sense Hub: </h5>
    <p>
    Qlik Sense Hub acts as a platform to the user where they can perform various operations on data, conduct analysis, and build applications that are suitable for data visualization. It comes with the unique features like drag and drops functionality, associative data models, a wide range of visualizations, and more, which makes the user build the flexible visualizations that suit for different screen sizes of various devices such as desktops, tabs, mobiles, etc. Qlik sense hub was developed using HTML5, JavaScript, CSS3,  etc.
    </p>
