<h5 id="WhatisQlikSense?"> What is Qlik Sense? </h5>
    <p>
    Qlik sense is an application released by QlikTech, which is specifically used for visualizing and analyzing the data. It helps in building interactive dashboards and reports,
        <br>
     and also to extract the data from various data sources. It mostly serves as an analytics platform for technical as well as non-technical developers and works better
        
     for data visualization as it has augmented graphics that help in effective visualization of data. 
    </p>
<h5 id="QlikSenseArchitecture">Qlik Sense Architecture Overview</h5>
    <p>
    Qlik Sense Architecture provides a scalable, secure, and manageable work environment for customers by offering high-quality services. It offers users with high visual
